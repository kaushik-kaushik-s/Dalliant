## Inspiration
Our team created this google extension to help many others with a serious problem. Many people that we know have trouble managing their time and limiting themselves to certain websites. This motivated us to create Dalliant. 

## What it does
Dalliant, the google extension, is a time management tool to keep the user on task. The user can then limit the time spent on each genre. The preferences are saved to the user's account, which could be created on our Wix website. Our extension can also display the user's google calendar so that they can have quick access to their important events. 

## How we built it
We built this extension by using many platforms like Wix, Cohere, and MongoDB.  Our extension takes the user preferences from our MongoDB server, attached to our Wix signup, to limit the amount of time spent on each genre of website. We used Cohere's classification AI to determine the type of website the user is on. 

## Challenges we ran into
Our team had to learn how to use most of the tools and coding languages during the hackathon. Documentation for some of the tools were also lacking.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of learning how to use new services and coding languages while making the extension. 

## What we learned
Cohere AI, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Velo Wix editor, MongoDB

## What's next for Code Blooded's Dalliant Chrome Extension 
As a team, we want to improve the chrome extension by changing the UI, adding more functionality, and adding it to the google store. 

## Makers
